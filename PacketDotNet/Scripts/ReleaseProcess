Generating release packages and updating source control (git)

- Check that the version set in AssemblyInfo.cs is correct for the next release
- Rebuild project
- Run the unit tests in Test/, they should all pass (or you should know why
  a given test isn't passing)
- Make sure all outstanding changes are checked in
- Tag trunk as the release, ex.
  git tag -a PacketDotNet_X_Y_Z
- Push tags to the server
  git push --tags
- Run build_release ~/packetdotnet_releases X.Y.Z X.Y.Z+1
- Edit ~/packetdotnet_releases/PacketDotNet_X_Y_Z+1_ReleaseNotes.txt with any additional
  notes about the changes in the newly released version
